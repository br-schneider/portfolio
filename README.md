# My Site

Welcome to my website! I'm excited to share with you some of my thoughts I have developed as a founding software engineer.

This website is built using some of my favorite web technologies and frameworks, including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and gaining a better understanding of my work. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to connect with others!
