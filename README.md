# Brett Schneider's Portfolio Website ðŸš€

Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm excited to share with you some of my thoughts I have developed as a full-stack software engineer.

This website is built using modern web technologies and frameworks, including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

Currently, I'm in the process of converting from JavaScript to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to improve the codebase's maintainability and scalability.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and gaining a better understanding of my work. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to connect with others in the tech community!
