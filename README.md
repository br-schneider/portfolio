# Welcome to My Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

---

I built the frontend for this site using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). For my backend I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com) along with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for my database. This also contains all my favorite projects and a blog. I hope you enjoy it!
