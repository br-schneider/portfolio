When approached with creating an e-commerce app, it's pretty easy to pop up the
same old Shopify or Squarespace page. But what happens if you want a more
tailored customer experience that the larger companies don't offer with the
convenience of all the tools they provide? With the power of headless
e-commerce, you can have the best of both worlds.

Many options are out there, and many more are popping up by the day, but for
this article, I'll talk specifically about how great it was using CommerceJS.
They made it a super smooth experience to get up and running. Once you create
your account, you are ready to start integrating their SDK into your page. I
first noticed how seamless it was to create a product and add all of the
descriptors/attributes in a Shopify-like manner. Then, it was as easy as
running:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const { data: products } = await commerce.products.list()

  return {
    props: {
      products,
    },
  }
}
```

And that's it! You have a list of products that you can use to populate your
page. You can also create a cart, checkout, and even integrate with Stripe to
accept payments. One useful feature I found was their
ability to create a custom checkout flow. I think many people struggle with developing a checkout flow, and CommerceJS makes it super easy to do
so. They make shipping, taxes, and discounts a breeze to implement. In this
article:
https://commercejs.com/blog/integrating-shippo-at-the-checkout-for-custom-shipping-rates/
they show how to integrate Shippo to get real-time shipping rates. One of the
more difficult tasks to implement without a big company like Shopify or
Squarespace. Below is a code snippet of a quick serverless NodeJS function that
I was able to pop up using CommerceJS and Shippo SDKs to get real-time shipping
rates:

```js
import Commerce from "@chec/commerce.js";
const commerce = new Commerce(process.env.CHEC_P_KEY);
const shippo = require("shippo")(process.env.SHIPPO_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { token, address } = req.query;

  if (!token || !address) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: "MISSING_ATTRIBUTES",
      message: "A token or address must be provided",
    });
  }

  const checkAddress = JSON.parse(address);

  const validation = await shippo.address.create(
    {
      name: checkAddress.name,
      street1: checkAddress.street1,
      street2: checkAddress.street2,
      city: checkAddress.city,
      state: checkAddress.state,
      zip: checkAddress.postCode,
      country: checkAddress.country,
      validate: true,
    },
    function (err, address) {
      console.log(err);
      console.log(address);
    }
  );

  const promises = [];
  promises.push(commerce.checkout.getLive(token));

  const merchantAddress = {
    name: "example",
    street1: "example",
    street2: "example",
    city: "example",
    zip: "example",
    state: "example",
    country: "example",
    phone: "5127399361",
  };

  // add customs declaration if necessary
  let shipment = {};
  if (address.country !== "US") {
    var customsItem = {
      description: "T-Shirt Purchase",
      quantity: 1,
      net_weight: "2",
      mass_unit: "lb",
      value_amount: "200",
      value_currency: "USD",
      origin_country: "US",
    };

    const customsDeclaration = await shippo.customsdeclaration.create(
      {
        contents_type: "MERCHANDISE",
        contents_explanation: "T-Shirt purchase",
        non_delivery_option: "RETURN",
        certify: true,
        certify_signer: "Brett Schneider",
        items: [customsItem],
      },
      function (err, customsDeclaration) {
        // asynchronously called
        console.log(err);
        console.log(customsDeclaration);
      }
    );

    shipment = await shippo.shipment.create(
      {
        address_from: merchantAddress,
        address_to: JSON.parse(address),
        customs_declaration: customsDeclaration,
        parcels: {
          length: "10",
          width: "10",
          height: "5",
          distance_unit: "in",
          weight: "2",
          mass_unit: "lb",
        },
      },
      function (err, shipment) {
        console.log(err);
        console.log(shipment);
      }
    );
  } else {
    shipment = await shippo.shipment.create(
      {
        address_from: merchantAddress,
        address_to: JSON.parse(address),
        parcels: {
          length: "10",
          width: "10",
          height: "5",
          distance_unit: "in",
          weight: "2",
          mass_unit: "lb",
        },
      },
      function (err, shipment) {
        console.log(err);
        console.log(shipment);
      }
    );
  }

  console.log(validation.validation_results);

  if (validation.validation_results.is_valid === false) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: validation.validation_results.messages[0].code,
      message: validation.validation_results.messages[0].text,
    });
  }

  // Shippo address check comes back invalid, run error message
  if (!shipment.address_to.is_complete || !shipment.rates) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: "INVALID_ADDRESS",
      message:
        "The provided address does not appear to be valid or can not be shipped to",
    });
  }

  // inject shippo shipping method to commercejs api portal
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.chec.io/v1/checkouts/${token}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Authorization": process.env.CHEC_S_KEY,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      shipping_methods: shipment.rates.map(
        ({ object_id: id, provider, amount, servicelevel: { name } }) => ({
          id,
          description: `${provider}: ${name}`,
          price: amount,
        })
      ),
    }),
  }).then((response) => response.json());

  return res.status(200).json(response.shipping_methods);
```

I know this might be a relatively long chunk of code, but I felt like it was
important to show all the ins and outs of the function along with how easy it
was to do some relatively complex tasks with the combined power of both
CommerceJS and Shippo. I was even able to create a customs declaration for
International shipping. With a little bit of help from this function and a few
other payment processing functions, I was able to create a fully functioning
e-commerce website in a matter of days. The amazing part is it all plugs into
the CommerceJS portal so you can manage your products, orders, and customers all
In one place. Here is a screenshot of a typical order in the CommerceJS portal:

There is a lot more to the CommerceJS API than what I have shown here, but I
hope this gives you a good idea of what it can do. I am very excited to see
what the future holds for CommerceJS and I hope you are too. If you are
