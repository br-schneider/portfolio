# Backend

---

The following files are serverless [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) api routes used to pull in the content for my frontend. I am currently in the process of converting from my old Strapi backend so the routes are being built over some time.

The current routes are:

- `/api/projects` - Returns all projects
