# Portfolio Backend - Powering the Frontend ðŸ’ª

---

Welcome to the backend of my portfolio website! This serverless [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) API is the driving force behind the dynamic and interactive frontend.

The backend is designed to provide seamless access to all the necessary information that is required to populate the frontend. Currently, I am in the process of migrating from an old Strapi backend, and as a result, the routes are being developed over time.

Here's a list of the available routes:

- `/api/projects` - This route returns all the projects that are featured on the portfolio website.

I'm constantly working to improve the backend, so stay tuned for updates and new features!
