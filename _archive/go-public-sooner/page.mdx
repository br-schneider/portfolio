Here's another article and another mention of the best podcast around, BG2.
After listening to their most recent recap of the Coatue EMW conference, I was
intrigued by something I've heard increasingly often: stop waiting to go public.
The landscape of tech IPOs is undergoing a significant shift, with an all-time
low in IPOs and an increasing number of companies choosing to stay private. This
shift can be attributed to many reasons, but I found a few of them to be
particularly interesting. 

## Lofty metrics and thresholds
Too many artificial hurdles and metrics are being thrown into the court of
public opinion. The most recent one is the consensus that a tech company needs
to hit a ten billion dollar market cap or a billion in revenue to be ready to
IPO. This metric seems a little lofty for some companies out there that have
been stuck in the private market for years.

## Companies are afraid of markdowns
According to Coatue's data, many secondary markets are currently trading at the
same discount (from their peak) as the public markets. For many large private
companies, there seems to be the attitude that they can avoid being marked down
if they don't go public. This is unrealistic, and sooner or later, they will
have to take their medicine and potentially lower the valuation of their
company.
