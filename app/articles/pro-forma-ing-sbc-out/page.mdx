After seeing the buzz around pro forma financials in the tech industry, I felt
compelled to discuss why removing stock-based compensation (SBC) from your
financial statements is a risky move. We'll start with what pro forma financials
entail, delve into the drawbacks of excluding SBC, and finally, explore better
alternatives.

## What are pro forma financials?

Pro forma financials are adjusted statements that reflect the impact of specific
events or transactions, whether past or anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA, for
example, is a common pro forma metric that can exclude this non-cash expense to
show a company’s earnings without the impact of SBC.

Such statements are particularly useful for companies undergoing significant
changes like acquisitions or restructuring, or those wanting to underscore
certain financial aspects not obvious from standard GAAP statements.


## Why pro forma-ing SBC out of your financials is a bad idea

Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense linked to granting equity options
or other equity forms as employee compensation. It's a staple in the tech
sector, helping attract and retain talent as well as aligning employee interests
with those of the company.

Excluding SBC from your financials is problematic for several reasons:

1. **It Misrepresents Financial Health**: SBC, though not a cash expense, still
   reflects a real cost. Omitting it paints an incomplete and potentially
   misleading picture of your financial health, complicating investor
   assessments of your company’s profitability.

2. **It sets a dangerous precedent**: If you start excluding SBC out of your
    financials, what’s to stop you from adjusting other expenses as well? This
    can lead to a slippery slope where companies are able to manipulate their
    financial statements to make themselves look more profitable than they
    really are.

3. **It undermines the credibility of your financial statements**: Investors
    rely on your financial statements to make informed investment decisions. If
    they see that you’re excluding SBC out of your financials, they may
    question the integrity of your financial reporting and be less likely to
    trust the information you provide.

Consider Snapchat's experience with excluding SBC, which has been criticized for
enriching executives at the expense of shareholders, highlighting the potential
consequences of such practices.

## The only alternative: show SBC in your financial statements

So, what's the alternative, you ask? Simply put, just don't do it. Instead,
consider what showing SBC in your financial statements can do for your company.
It gives a sobering view of your financial health, helps investors make informed
decisions, and builds trust in your financial reporting. It's a strategy that
benefits all parties involved.

Excluding SBC can mislead, create dangerous precedents, and erode trust. By
presenting SBC transparently in your financials, you ensure a more accurate and
reliable portrayal of your company’s financial wellbeing, attracting investors
and establishing your reporting's credibility.
