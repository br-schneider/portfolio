I acknowledge it's been a while since my last blog post. Interestingly, I
decided to dive back into writing by tackling the topic of customizing
scrollbars. While working on a new project featuring beautifully rounded
corners, I noticed the default scrollbars detracted from the design. Having seen
elegant custom scrollbars before, I decided to give customization a try.

## The Problem
Many aesthetically pleasing websites are marred by unsightly scrollbars. Take
[Shadcn's website](https://ui.shadcn.com/), for example, where some components are overshadowed by
unattractive scrollbars:
<Image src={shadCnScrollbars} alt="A screenshot of Shadcn's website showcasing an elegant component marred by an unsightly scrollbar"  /> 
This issue echoed in my project, particularly at the ends of the main content area:
<Image src={badCorner} alt="Screenshot showing an ill-fitted corner due to the default scrollbar"  /> 
<Image src={goodCorner} alt="Screenshot displaying the desired rounded corner without the default scrollbar"  />

## My First Attempt
My immediate reaction was to hop on over to [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and
use his very nice [Scroll-area
component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/scroll-area). This component is
great, however, you need to explicitly use it in every component that you want
to have a non-native scrollbar. This was not what I wanted. I wanted to have a
global scrollbar that would be applied to every scrollbar on the website without
much effort. 

## The Solution
After sifting through numerous complex or ineffective solutions online, I
discovered a straightforward and effective approach. The main reason I decided
to write this article was to hopefully save someone out there some time, as it
took me way too long to get it just right. I understand that everyone has
different tastes, so I will provide you with the code, and you can customize it
to your liking. The following CSS, when added to your global stylesheet, offers
a customizable and elegant scrollbar design, saving you time and enhancing your
site's aesthetics:

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 10px; /* Adjust the width to create space for padding */
  height: 10px; /* Adjust the height to create space for padding */
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: transparent; /* Ensure the track is transparent */
  border-radius: 10px; /* Match the border-radius of the thumb */
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #c0c0c0; /* You can adjust this color for the thumb */
  border-radius: 9999px; /* Match the border-radius of the thumb */
  background-clip: content-box; /* Ensure the thumb doesn't overlap the track */
  border: 2px solid transparent; /* Ensure the thumb doesn't overlap the track */
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px transparent; /* Extend the padding with a transparent box-shadow */
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background: #c0c0c0; /* You can adjust this color for the hover state */
}
```

Thank you for reading! I hope this guide simplifies your web design process and inspires more visually cohesive interfaces.
