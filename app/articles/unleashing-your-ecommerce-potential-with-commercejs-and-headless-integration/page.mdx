When approached with creating an e-commerce app, it's pretty easy to pop up the
same old Shopify or Squarespace page. But what happens if you want a more
tailored customer experience that the larger companies don't offer with the
convenience of all the tools they provide? With the power of headless
e-commerce, you can have the best of both worlds.

Many options are out there, and many more are popping up by the day, but for
this article, I'll talk specifically about how great it was using CommerceJS.
They made it a super smooth experience to get up and running. Once you create
your account, you are ready to start integrating their SDK into your page. I
first noticed how seamless it was to create a product and add all of the
descriptors/attributes in a Shopify-like manner. Then, it was as easy as
running:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const { data: products } = await commerce.products.list()

  return {
    props: {
      products,
    },
  }
}
```

And that's it! You have a list of products that you can use to populate your
page. You can also create a cart, checkout, and even integrate with Stripe to
accept payments. One useful feature I found was their ability to create a custom
checkout flow. I think many people struggle with developing a checkout flow, and
CommerceJS makes it super easy to do so. They make shipping, taxes, and
discounts a breeze to implement. In this
[article](https://commercejs.com/blog/integrating-shippo-at-the-checkout-for-custom-shipping-rates/)
they show how to integrate Shippo to get real-time shipping rates. One of the
more difficult tasks to implement without a big company like Shopify or
Squarespace. Below is a code snippet of a quick serverless NodeJS function I
scaffolded out using CommerceJS and Shippo SDKs to get real-time shipping rates:

```js
import Commerce from "@chec/commerce.js";
const commerce = new Commerce(process.env.CHEC_P_KEY);
const shippo = require("shippo")(process.env.SHIPPO_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { token, address } = req.query;

  if (!token || !address) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: "MISSING_ATTRIBUTES",
      message: "A token or address must be provided",
    });
  }

  const checkAddress = JSON.parse(address);

  const validation = await shippo.address.create(
    {
      name: checkAddress.name,
      street1: checkAddress.street1,
      street2: checkAddress.street2,
      city: checkAddress.city,
      state: checkAddress.state,
      zip: checkAddress.postCode,
      country: checkAddress.country,
      validate: true,
    },
    function (err, address) {
      console.info(err);
      console.info(address);
    }
  );

  const promises = [];
  promises.push(commerce.checkout.getLive(token));

  const merchantAddress = {
    name: "example",
    street1: "example",
    street2: "example",
    city: "example",
    zip: "example",
    state: "example",
    country: "example",
    phone: "5127399361",
  };

  // add customs declaration if necessary
  let shipment = {};
  if (address.country !== "US") {
    var customsItem = {
      description: "T-Shirt Purchase",
      quantity: 1,
      net_weight: "2",
      mass_unit: "lb",
      value_amount: "200",
      value_currency: "USD",
      origin_country: "US",
    };

    const customsDeclaration = await shippo.customsdeclaration.create(
      {
        contents_type: "MERCHANDISE",
        contents_explanation: "T-Shirt purchase",
        non_delivery_option: "RETURN",
        certify: true,
        certify_signer: "Brett Schneider",
        items: [customsItem],
      },
      function (err, customsDeclaration) {
        // asynchronously called
        console.info(err);
        console.info(customsDeclaration);
      }
    );

    shipment = await shippo.shipment.create(
      {
        address_from: merchantAddress,
        address_to: JSON.parse(address),
        customs_declaration: customsDeclaration,
        parcels: {
          length: "10",
          width: "10",
          height: "5",
          distance_unit: "in",
          weight: "2",
          mass_unit: "lb",
        },
      },
      function (err, shipment) {
        console.info(err);
        console.info(shipment);
      }
    );
  } else {
    shipment = await shippo.shipment.create(
      {
        address_from: merchantAddress,
        address_to: JSON.parse(address),
        parcels: {
          length: "10",
          width: "10",
          height: "5",
          distance_unit: "in",
          weight: "2",
          mass_unit: "lb",
        },
      },
      function (err, shipment) {
        console.info(err);
        console.info(shipment);
      }
    );
  }

  console.info(validation.validation_results);

  if (validation.validation_results.is_valid === false) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: validation.validation_results.messages[0].code,
      message: validation.validation_results.messages[0].text,
    });
  }

  // Shippo address check comes back invalid, run error message
  if (!shipment.address_to.is_complete || !shipment.rates) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      code: "INVALID_ADDRESS",
      message:
        "The provided address does not appear to be valid or can not be shipped to",
    });
  }

  // inject shippo shipping method to commercejs api portal
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.chec.io/v1/checkouts/${token}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Authorization": process.env.CHEC_S_KEY,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      shipping_methods: shipment.rates.map(
        ({ object_id: id, provider, amount, servicelevel: { name } }) => ({
          id,
          description: `${provider}: ${name}`,
          price: amount,
        })
      ),
    }),
  }).then((response) => response.json());

  return res.status(200).json(response.shipping_methods);
}

```

Though the code I included is a little long, it underscores the seamless capability to execute
complex tasks, including international shipping considerations, within a concise
framework. This functionality, along with other payment processing features,
enabled the swift creation of a fully functional e-commerce site. All
operational aspects—products, orders, customers—are managed through the
CommerceJS portal, simplifying backend complexities.
