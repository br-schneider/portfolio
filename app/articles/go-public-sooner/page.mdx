Here's another article and another mention of the best podcast around, BG2. In a
recent episode of the pod, they recapped the Coatue EMW
conference and sparked a thought-provoking conversation about the shifting
landscape of tech IPOs. With IPOs at an all-time low and more companies opting
to stay private, it's worth exploring why this trend is happening and whether it
benefits these companies.

## Lofty Metrics and Thresholds
A significant barrier to going public is the increasingly high benchmarks that
companies are expected to meet. The prevailing wisdom at the moment suggests
that a tech company needs to reach a $10 billion market cap or $1 billion in
revenue before considering an IPO. This expectation can be daunting, especially
for companies thriving in the private market but yet to hit these arbitrary
thresholds.

Often dictated by market sentiment and investor expectations, these lofty
metrics can seem impossible. However, they shouldn't be the sole determinants of
a company's readiness to go public. For many companies, waiting to meet these
thresholds could mean missing out on crucial growth opportunities and market
presence.

## The Fear of Markdowns
According to data from Coatue, many secondary markets are currently trading at
the same discount as public markets. This parity challenges the belief that
staying private shields companies from the volatility and scrutiny of public
markets. In reality, these companies will eventually need to face the music. The
reluctance to go public often stems from a fear of markdowns and the
transparency of public trading. However, this avoidance can be a double-edged
sword. Investors are increasingly savvy and will inevitably find ways to
appraise a company's true value, regardless of its public or private status.

## The Myth of Stability
There's a standard narrative that staying private offers stability that public
companies lack. This narrative falls apart under scrutiny. Just because a
company doesn't face daily public market valuations doesn't mean its intrinsic
value remains unchanged. Private companies are not immune to market forces, and
their valuations can fluctuate based on the same economic conditions affecting
public companies.

## The Advantage of Liquidity
While some argue that going public too soon can result in becoming a micro-cap
company with limited analyst coverage, the benefits of liquidity often outweigh
these concerns. Being a public company provides access to a broader range of
investors and can facilitate more significant capital-raising opportunities.
Moreover, the public market can offer discipline and scrutiny that drives better
corporate governance and operational efficiency. The transparency and
accountability required of public companies can lead to more sustainable growth
in the long run.

## Conclusion
The tech IPO landscape is shifting, but the underlying reasons for staying
private may hold less water than they once did. Companies should consider the
benefits of going public sooner rather than later. The artificial thresholds and
fear of markdowns should be balanced with the advantages of liquidity, broader
investor access, and the growth opportunities that come with being a public
company.

Ultimately, it's about striking the right balance and making strategic decisions
that align with the company's long-term vision and growth objectives. The sooner
companies embrace the reality of the market and leverage the opportunities
available, the better positioned they will be for sustainable success.
