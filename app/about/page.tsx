              I build products that turn complex ideas into clear, useful
              software. Over the years I have shipped production systems and
              guided lean teams at venture-backed startups, always with an eye
              on real-world results.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work sits at the intersection of code and entrepreneurship. I
              have launched SaaS products, grown design systems, and led
              early-stage teams from first sketch to public release. Whatever
              the project, my goal is to make technology friendly and valuable
              for the people who rely on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I care deeply about the way design and engineering meet. A product
              shines when its logic feels effortless and its interface feels
              welcoming, so I shape clean architecture, intuitive flows, and
              purposeful features at every step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curiosity keeps me moving. If you would like to trade ideas,
              collaborate, or simply say hello, reach out through the links
